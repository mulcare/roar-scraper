# ROAR Scraper
##Description
This tool is designed to gather the win-loss records and other information about
scenarios for the board game Advanced Square Leader. The data is scraped from
the [_R_emote _O_n-line _A_utomated _R_ecord
(ROAR)](http://www.jrvdev.com/ROAR/VER1/default.asp), a database of scenario
results dating from 1997 to the present.

Please be considerate when using this tool. ROAR is a one-man operation, and
a vital resource for ASL players. Please use sane delays on requests to avoid
hammering the ROAR server.

## Dependencies
